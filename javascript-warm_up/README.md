## Introduction

JavaScript is a versatile and widely-used programming language known for its ability to add interactivity to web pages. It's used in both front-end and back-end development, making it a valuable skill for any developer.

Let's review some fundamental JavaScript concepts.

## Variables

Variables allow you to store and manipulate data. You can declare them using `let`, `const`, or `var`. Here's a quick example:

```javascript
let name = "John";
const age = 25;
var isStudent = true;
```

## Data Types

JavaScript supports various data types, including numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, objects, and more. Understanding data types is crucial when working with JavaScript.

## Operators

Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values. JavaScript supports arithmetic, comparison, logical, and assignment operators.

## Control Flow

Control flow statements like `if`, `else`, `switch`, and loops (`for`, `while`) help you control the flow of your program.

## Functions

Functions are reusable blocks of code that can take input (parameters) and return a value. They are essential for organizing and modularizing your code.

Here's a simple function that adds two numbers:

```javascript
function addNumbers(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

const result = addNumbers(5, 7);
console.log(result); // Output: 12
```

## Arrays

Arrays are used to store collections of data. You can access, manipulate, and iterate through array elements.

## Objects

Objects allow you to create complex data structures. They consist of key-value pairs and are fundamental for many JavaScript applications.

Here's a basic object example:

```javascript
const person = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 30,
  isStudent: false,
};
```

## Practice Exercises

To warm up your JavaScript skills, here are a few exercises to tackle:

1. Write a function that returns the square of a given number.
2. Create an array of your favorite fruits and loop through it to print each fruit's name.
3. Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of all the numbers in the array.
4. Create an object representing a book with properties like title, author, and publication year.

Feel free to explore these exercises and experiment with JavaScript. Practice is key to mastering this language. Happy coding!
