### 1. Lexical Scoping
Lexical scoping refers to how variable names are resolved in nested functions. JavaScript uses a "scope chain" to find variables. Variables declared inside a function are accessible only within that function, but they can access variables in the parent scope. Example:

```javascript
function outer() {
  const outerVar = 1;

  function inner() {
    const innerVar = 2;
    console.log(outerVar + innerVar); // Accesses outerVar from the parent scope
  }

  inner();
}

outer(); // Outputs: 3
```

### 2. Closures
Closures are functions that "remember" the scope in which they were created, even if they are executed outside that scope. They encapsulate variables, preventing them from being garbage-collected. Example:

```javascript
function createCounter() {
  let count = 0;

  return function () {
    return ++count;
  };
}

const counter = createCounter();
console.log(counter()); // Outputs: 1
console.log(counter()); // Outputs: 2
```

### 3. Call Stack
The call stack is a data structure that keeps track of function calls in your code. Functions are pushed onto the stack when they are called and popped off when they return. It helps maintain the order of execution. Example:

```javascript
function first() {
  console.log("First function");
  second();
  console.log("First function again");
}

function second() {
  console.log("Second function");
}

first();
```

Output:
```
First function
Second function
First function again
```

### 4. Binding
Binding in JavaScript refers to how the `this` keyword is assigned within functions. It depends on how a function is called. The value of `this` can change based on whether the function is invoked as a method, constructor, or standalone function. Example:

```javascript
const person = {
  name: "John",
  greet: function () {
    console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}!`);
  },
};

person.greet(); // Outputs: Hello, John!

const greetFunction = person.greet;
greetFunction(); // Outputs: Hello, undefined! (this is not bound to person)
```

### 5. Callbacks
Callbacks are functions passed as arguments to other functions and are executed after a specific task is completed. They are commonly used in asynchronous operations, such as with `setTimeout` or handling events. Example:

```javascript
function fetchData(url, callback) {
